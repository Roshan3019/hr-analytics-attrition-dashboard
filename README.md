**### Key Attributes**

**- Attrition status (target variable)**

**- Department and job role**

**- Age and age bands**

**- Gender and education field**

**- Job satisfaction and work–life balance**

**- Compensation and tenure metrics**

**## Dashboard Summary**

**The Tableau dashboard presents:**

**- Executive-level KPIs (Headcount, Attrition Rate, Active Employees)**

**- Department-wise and role-wise attrition distribution**

**- Age group and gender-based attrition patterns**

**- Job satisfaction heatmap across roles**

**- Education field impact on attrition**



**---**



**## Key Analytical Insights**

**- Overall attrition rate is approximately \*\*16%\*\*, indicating moderate workforce churn.**

**- \*\*Sales department\*\* contributes the highest attrition, signaling operational and revenue risk.**

**- \*\*Under-25 employees exhibit disproportionately high attrition\*\*, suggesting early-career disengagement.**

**- Employees with \*\*low job satisfaction and poor work-life balance\*\* are significantly more likely to exit.**

**- \*\*Sales Representatives and entry-level roles\*\* show attrition rates far above the organizational average.**

**- Research and managerial roles demonstrate stronger retention, indicating stability and clearer career progression.**



**---**



**## Business Recommendations**

**- \*\*Strengthen early-career onboarding\*\***  

  **Implement structured mentorship and career roadmaps for employees under 25 to reduce early exits.**



**- \*\*Target Sales role retention\*\***
